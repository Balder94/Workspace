    About Me
    </h2>
        <p>
        I am Balder Claassen. I spread love and am always interested in meeting other love spreading world savers. ^^ Or anyone who wants to have interesting philosophical conversations. Or if those 2 don't apply I very well still might be interested to get to know you. Life is a journey, we keep on learning. :)

    <h3>
    Swedish
    </h3>
        <p>
        One of the things I am working on is learning      Swedish. I say learning, but I am mostly interested in using/speaking the language, I love the sound of it. The    learning will come when it comes. 
        </p>

    <h4>
    Programming
    </h4>
        <p>
        Another of my projects at the moment is learning   Javascript, HTML and CSS. I am loving to learn how to write websites like this one. Or small programs like my <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/ovrxLe2u>Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> game.

    <h5>
    Recomendations
    </h5>
        <p>
        Here is a couple of things I am pretty enthousiastic about: 
            <ul>
                <li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience>Spirit Science</a></li>
                <li><a href=https://www.codecademy.com/learn>Codecademy</a></li>Great tool to learn how to program
                <li><a href=https://www.duolingo.com/>Duolingo</a></li>Great language learning tool
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        And a couple of things I find very interesting:
            <ul>
                <li><a href=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf>How money is created.</a></li>According to the central bank of England (2014): "But how those bank deposits (97% of all money) are created is often misunderstood: the principal way is through commercial banks making loans. Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower's bank account, thereby creating new money."
                <li><a href=http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/>Zeitgeist The Movie.</a></li>Really interesting documentaries which talk about the above, money creation, but also about the society we live in and how it relates to the economy and how the system is setup. In the third film they also dive into how we could make a better system, if we would look at earth from the start, how to best organize live on this planet. I personally found 2 and 3 very interesting films.   
                <li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUS1m5MSt9k>Government explained by an alien.</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        And one more list, of all the things I've build in javascript:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></li>A simple 2 player Rock Paper Scissors game.
                <li><a href="#">BTW tool (21)</a></li>This is a simple tool to help small companies in holland speed up some calculations for filing taxes by calculating 21% of any amount.
            </ul>
        </p>
